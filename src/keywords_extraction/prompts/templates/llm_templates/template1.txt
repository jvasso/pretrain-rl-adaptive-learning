Question: I want you to extract keywords from this document.
As a first step, you will examine every single term in this document and extract them if they refer to a technical concept closely related to the academic area of the document. The more the better. You directly output a python list of strings (for example: “machine learning”, “neural network” etc.). Don’t write anything else (no explanation, no introduction, no text).
As a second step, you will associate each term with its corresponding Wikipedia page (Wikipedia ID) if it exists. Drop the terms that don’t have a Wikipedia page. Directly output a python list of strings of Wikipedia IDs (for example: “Machine_learning”, “Artificial_neural_network” etc.). Again, don’t write anything else.
The document starts here.
